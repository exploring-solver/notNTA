For Phase 1.1 and 1.2 of the "notNTA" project, the folder structure and modular approach will help keep the codebase clean, scalable, and maintainable. Here's a suggested folder structure and modular breakdown for the Express backend and the Vite React frontend:

### **1. Backend Folder Structure (Express + Socket.IO + MongoDB)**

The backend will handle server-side operations, including the game logic, real-time communication with Socket.IO, and database interactions using MongoDB.

```
backend/
├── config/
│   ├── default.json           # Configuration for different environments
│   └── db.js                  # MongoDB connection setup
├── controllers/
│   ├── gameController.js      # Logic for game-related operations
│   └── userController.js      # Logic for user-related operations (future use)
├── models/
│   └── Game.js                # Mongoose schema for the Game
├── routes/
│   ├── gameRoutes.js          # Routes for game-related operations
│   └── userRoutes.js          # Routes for user-related operations (future use)
├── sockets/
│   └── gameSocket.js          # Socket.IO handlers for game events
├── middleware/
│   └── authMiddleware.js      # Middleware for authentication (future use)
├── utils/
│   └── gameUtils.js           # Utility functions for game logic
├── server.js                  # Main entry point for the backend server
└── package.json               # Dependencies and scripts
```

#### **Explanation of Backend Structure:**

1. **`config/`**: Contains configuration files, like the database URI and other settings for different environments (development, production).

2. **`controllers/`**: Manages the core logic for handling requests and interactions with the database.

3. **`models/`**: Contains Mongoose models for different entities. In Phase 1.1, it includes only the `Game` model, but more models (like `User`) can be added later.

4. **`routes/`**: Defines the API endpoints for different modules. Game-related routes will be handled in `gameRoutes.js`, and user-related routes can be added later.

5. **`sockets/`**: Manages Socket.IO events and real-time communication for the game. This is where the game socket logic resides.

6. **`middleware/`**: For custom middleware functions like authentication, to be used in later phases.

7. **`utils/`**: Helper functions related to game logic, such as scoring calculations and question management.

8. **`server.js`**: The main entry point for the Express server, where the server is set up with routes, middleware, and Socket.IO configuration.

### **2. Frontend Folder Structure (Vite + React)**

The frontend will be implemented using Vite and React. It will include components for different views, state management, and utilities for making API calls.

```
frontend/
├── public/                     # Public assets, such as images and static files
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── GameInfo.jsx        # Component for displaying game information
│   │   ├── QuestionCard.jsx    # Component for displaying a question
│   │   └── Timer.jsx           # Timer component for the countdown
│   ├── pages/
│   │   ├── Home.jsx            # Home page component (start game, join team)
│   │   └── GameScreen.jsx      # Game screen component for playing the game
│   ├── hooks/
│   │   └── useSocket.js        # Custom hook for managing Socket.IO connections
│   ├── context/
│   │   └── GameContext.js      # Context for managing game state across components
│   ├── services/
│   │   └── api.js              # API service for making HTTP requests
│   ├── utils/
│   │   └── helpers.js          # Helper functions for frontend logic
│   ├── App.jsx                 # Main App component
│   ├── main.jsx                # Entry point for Vite
│   └── index.css               # Global CSS styles
└── package.json                # Dependencies and scripts
```

#### **Explanation of Frontend Structure:**

1. **`public/`**: Contains public assets like images, icons, and static files. These files are served directly without being bundled.

2. **`src/components/`**: Reusable components that make up the game UI. Examples include `GameInfo.jsx` for showing game stats, `QuestionCard.jsx` for displaying questions, and `Timer.jsx` for showing the countdown timer.

3. **`src/pages/`**: Contains page-level components representing different views of the application. `Home.jsx` handles the initial game setup and team joining, while `GameScreen.jsx` manages the main game interface.

4. **`src/hooks/`**: Custom hooks, such as `useSocket.js`, to manage Socket.IO connections and handle socket events.

5. **`src/context/`**: Uses React Context API to share the game state across different components. `GameContext.js` will provide the context for managing game-related data.

6. **`src/services/`**: Contains functions to interact with the backend API. For example, `api.js` provides functions to start a new game or fetch game data.

7. **`src/utils/`**: Helper functions for formatting data, managing time, or other utility operations.

8. **`App.jsx`**: The main component where different routes and contexts are configured.

9. **`main.jsx`**: The entry point for the Vite application. This is where the root component (`App.jsx`) is rendered.

### **3. Modular Approach to Development**

For Phase 1.1 and 1.2, the development will be broken down into the following modules:

#### **Module 1: Game Management**

- **Backend:**
  - `gameController.js` will handle creating a new game, updating game state, and managing scores.
  - `Game.js` (model) will define the schema for storing game data in MongoDB.
  - `gameRoutes.js` will define the endpoints for creating a game and retrieving game status.
- **Frontend:**
  - `Home.jsx` will allow users to start a game and join a team.
  - `GameScreen.jsx` will display the ongoing game state and questions.
  - `api.js` will have methods for interacting with game-related API endpoints.

#### **Module 2: Real-Time Communication (Sockets)**

- **Backend:**
  - `gameSocket.js` will manage the Socket.IO events for joining games, answering questions, and updating scores.
- **Frontend:**
  - `useSocket.js` will handle socket connections and listen for events such as `playerJoined`, `updateGameState`, and `gameOver`.
  - `GameContext.js` will manage the state updates based on socket events.

#### **Module 3: Host Controls and Game Settings**

- **Backend:**
  - Expand `gameController.js` to include functions for modifying game settings and kicking players.
  - Add middleware for authorization to ensure only hosts can modify settings.
- **Frontend:**
  - Add host controls in `GameScreen.jsx` for managing players and modifying game settings.
  - Create settings components for configuring the number of rounds, time per question, and question types.

### **4. Integration of Modules**

- **Backend Integration:**
  - Set up `server.js` to use routes from `gameRoutes.js` and configure Socket.IO with `gameSocket.js`.
  - Use middleware to authenticate host actions in Phase 1.2.

- **Frontend Integration:**
  - Use React Context to share game state across components and manage updates.
  - Set up event listeners for real-time updates and integrate host controls in the UI.

### **5. Technology Stack Summary**

- **Frontend:** Vite + React for fast development and component-based architecture.
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express for handling API requests and Socket.IO for real-time communication.
- **Database:** MongoDB to store game state, questions, and settings.

### **Additional Considerations**

- **Phase 1.1 and 1.2 Dependencies:**
  - For the backend, include dependencies like `express`, `mongoose`, `socket.io`, and `dotenv`.
  - For the frontend, include dependencies like `react`, `react-dom`, `socket.io-client`, and `axios` for API calls.
  
- **Environment Configuration:**
  - Use `.env` files for managing environment variables like database URIs and server ports.

This structure will provide a strong foundation for the initial phases and will allow for easy scalability and modular development as new features are added in future phases.
