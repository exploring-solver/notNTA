To implement the "notNTA" project based on the described requirements, the backend and database architecture need to support real-time game interactions, persistent game states, and user management. Here's an overview of the backend architecture, database schema, and the interaction with the frontend components and screens.

---

### **Backend Architecture Overview**

The backend will be built using **Node.js** with **Express.js** and **Socket.IO** for real-time communication. The database will be **MongoDB** using **Mongoose** for object modeling. This architecture will handle user authentication (if required in later phases), game management, and real-time updates through WebSockets.

#### **Backend Structure**

```

│   └── db.js                  # Database connection setup
├── controllers/
│   ├── gameController.js      # Game creation, joining, and updating logic

```

### **Database Architecture Overview**

The database will be **MongoDB**, which is suitable for storing complex game states and managing real-time updates. Below are the key collections and their schemas:

#### **Database Schema**

1. **Game Schema (`Game.js`)**
   
   This schema will track the game state, settings, players, and questions. 

   ```javascript
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');

   const GameSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
     roomCode: { type: String, unique: true },
     hostId: { type: String, required: true },
     players: [
       {
         socketId: String,
         userId: String,
         name: String,
         team: String, // 'red' or 'blue'
         score: { type: Number, default: 0 },
         isHost: { type: Boolean, default: false },
       },
     ],
     settings: {
       rounds: { type: Number, default: 3 },
       timePerQuestion: { type: Number, default: 120 }, // in seconds
       questionType: { type: String, default: 'MCQ' },
       maxPlayers: { type: Number, default: 10 },
     },
     currentRound: { type: Number, default: 1 },
     gameState: { type: String, enum: ['lobby', 'playing', 'ended'], default: 'lobby' },
     redTeamScore: { type: Number, default: 0 },
     blueTeamScore: { type: Number, default: 0 },
     currentQuestion: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Question' }, // Reference to a question
     isActive: { type: Boolean, default: true },
   });

   module.exports = mongoose.model('Game', GameSchema);
   ```

2. **User Schema (`User.js`)** (Optional for future user management)

   ```javascript
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');

   const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
     name: { type: String, required: true },
     email: { type: String, unique: true }, // (optional)
     gamesPlayed: { type: Number, default: 0 },
     totalScore: { type: Number, default: 0 },
   });

   module.exports = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);
   ```

3. **Question Schema (`Question.js`)**

   Stores questions and metadata for different subjects and difficulty levels.

   ```javascript
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');

   const QuestionSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
     questionText: { type: String, required: true },
     options: [
       {
         text: String,
         isCorrect: Boolean,
       },
     ],
     subject: String,
     difficulty: { type: String, enum: ['easy', 'medium', 'hard'] },
     year: Number, // Year of PYQ
   });

   module.exports = mongoose.model('Question', QuestionSchema);
   ```

### **Backend and Frontend Interaction**

The backend will interact with the frontend through both **RESTful API endpoints** and **Socket.IO** events. Here’s an overview of how the interaction will work:

#### **Backend to Frontend Flow**

1. **Game Creation**
   - **Frontend:** User clicks "Create Game" after entering their name.
   - **Backend:** `POST /api/game/create` creates a new game, generates a room code, and assigns the user as the host.
   - **Frontend:** Receives `roomCode` and transitions to the **Lobby** screen.
   - **Socket:** Host joins the room via `socket.emit('join', { roomCode, name })`.

2. **Joining a Game**
   - **Frontend:** User enters a room code and their name, then clicks "Join Game."
   - **Backend:** `POST /api/game/join` verifies the room code and adds the user to the game.
   - **Frontend:** Receives confirmation and transitions to the **Lobby** screen.
   - **Socket:** Player joins the room via `socket.emit('join', { roomCode, name })`.

3. **Lobby Phase**
   - **Host Controls:** Host can change settings like number of rounds and kick players.
   - **Socket:** `setGameSettings`, `kickUser`, `startGame` are handled through socket events.
   - **Frontend:** Updates the lobby state dynamically as settings change or users join/leave.

4. **Starting the Game**
   - **Frontend:** Host clicks "Start Game."
   - **Socket:** `socket.emit('startGame')` triggers the game start on the server.
   - **Backend:** Updates game state to "playing" and sends the first question to the relevant player.

5. **Game Play**
   - **Question Distribution:** Each player receives a question during their turn.
   - **Socket:** `socket.emit('answerQuestion', { answer, questionId })` sends the player's answer to the server.
   - **Backend:** Validates the answer, updates scores, and sends back `questionAnswered` event with results.
   - **Frontend:** Displays feedback based on whether the answer was correct and updates the scoreboard.

6. **End of Rounds**
   - **Socket:** When a round ends, the server sends a `roundComplete` event.
   - **Backend:** Checks if all rounds are completed. If yes, triggers `gameOver` with final scores.
   - **Frontend:** Shows the **Winner Screen** with final scores and transitions to the **Lobby** screen again.

7. **Reconnections**
   - **Socket:** If a player disconnects, they can rejoin using the `socket.emit('reconnectToGame')`.
   - **Backend:** Checks if the user is part of the game and restores their session.

### **Frontend Components and Screens**

The frontend will be built using **Vite + React**. Below are the main screens and components needed:

#### **Screens**

1. **Home Screen (`Home.jsx`)**
   - User inputs their name.
   - Can choose to **Create Game** or **Join Game** using a room code.
   - Components:
     - `NameInput` - Text input for name.
     - `CreateGameButton` - Button to create a new game.
     - `JoinGameButton` - Button to join an existing game with a room code.

2. **Lobby Screen (`Lobby.jsx`)**
   - Displays players in the room, game settings, and host controls.
   - Host can start the game, kick players, or modify settings.
   - Components:
     - `PlayerList` - Shows a list of players and their status.
     - `GameSettings` - Allows the host to change rounds, time, etc.
     - `StartGameButton` - Visible only to the host to start the game.

3. **Game Screen (`GameScreen.jsx`)**
   - Displays the current question and answers.
   - Shows the game timer and scores.
   - Components:
     - `QuestionCard` - Displays the current question and options.
     - `Scoreboard` - Shows the scores of both teams.
     - `Timer` - Shows the countdown for answering.

4. **Winner Screen (`WinnerScreen.jsx`)**
   - Displays the winner and final scores.
   - Host can choose to restart the game.
   - Components:


     - `ResultsDisplay` - Shows the winning team and their score.
     - `RestartButton` - Button for the host to restart the game.

5. **Reconnection Handling**
   - If a player disconnects and rejoins, automatically take them back to the state they were in.
   - Show a loading or reconnecting message while the game state is restored.

#### **Key Frontend Components**

1. **Reusable Components**
   - `Button` - Styled button component.
   - `Modal` - For settings or confirm actions (kick player, change game settings).
   - `LoadingSpinner` - Indicates loading or waiting states.

2. **Socket Integration (`useSocket.js`)**
   - Custom React hook for managing socket events.
   - Listens to relevant socket events and updates the game state accordingly.

### **Conclusion**

This architecture ensures the backend and database can handle the different phases of the game and interact seamlessly with the frontend via RESTful APIs and Socket.IO events. The modular approach makes it easy to expand the game with additional features in later phases, like leaderboards, 1v1 matches, and anti-cheat mechanisms.
